## Description

This project demonstrates a cube animation created using CSS animations and transforms. The cube rotates within a 3D perspective scene and provides a visually appealing effect.

## Customization

You can customize the cube's appearance and animation by modifying the CSS variables in the `styles.css` file. Here are some of the variables you can adjust:

- `--boxColor`: Change the color of the cube faces.
- `--velocidadRotacion`: Adjust the rotation speed of the cube.
- `--saltoBola`: Modify the bouncing animation of the cube.

Feel free to experiment with these variables to create your own unique cube animation.
